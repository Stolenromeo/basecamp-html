                I don't want to go. You can spend the rest of your life with me, 
                but I can't spend the rest of mine with you. I have to live on. 
                Alone. That's the curse of the Time Lords. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 
                There's something else I've always wanted to say: Allons-y, Alonso! 
                It is! It's the city of New New York! Strictly speaking, it's the 
                fifteenth New York since the original, so that makes it 
                New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New New York. 
                You need to get yourself a better dictionary. When you do, look up 'genocide'. 
                You'll find a little picture of me there, and the caption'll read 'Over my dead body'.
